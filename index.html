                        <h1>OVERVIEW & MOTIVATION</h1>
                        <p>Howdy! We are Team Dabberlee, and our project is FoodDude. 
                            Our goal was to explore the different foods on the USDA database and see if there are foods out there that can provide all the necessary nutrients needed by a basic 2000 calorie diet. That is, if a single food could possibly be able to provide all the nutrients a human needs while staying within a reasonable calorie range.</p>
                        <p>Originally, one of our team members, Kyle Wilson, prepared a data science spotlight about trying to fulfill desired macronutrients for the least amount of money with fast food. We wanted to look more closely at food analysis through nutrients without regard to price. The USDA database provided us with nutrients for many groceries and fast foods, which gave us a nice base to work off of.</p>

                        <h1>RELATED WORK</h1>
                        <p>There are already foods out there such as Soylent, which advertises itself as a meal replacement that provides “all the protein, carbohydrates, lipids, and micronutrients that a body needs to thrive.” While Soylent is engineered specifically for this purpose, we wanted to see if there is a food already out there that can provide the same benefits that Soylent can.</p>

                        <li>What are the foods that provide all the nutritional value you need for the fewest amount of calories?</li>

                        <h1>EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS</h1>
                        <p>We got our data from the USDA database, which provided a CSV file that contained many foods that you would find in a grocery store and the nutritional information associated with each item. We then removed the foods that don’t contain all of the nutrients we are looking for and normalized every macronutrient to one calorie. With everything normalized, we scaled the foods up to meet the recommended intake for each nutrient.</p>

                        <p>As you can see, we have a lot of typical “healthy” foods, such as soups, potatoes, and baby food. Babies often have a very singular diet since they have yet to develop the ability to eat most foods, and it would only make sense that one of the very few foods they eat would contain a good balance of essential nutrients.</p>
                        <p></p>
	                    <p>After looking at the data it was hard to judge just how closely these foods stuck to the recommended amount of nutrients, so we converted the raw numbers into their percentage above the recommended daily amount.</p>
                        <h3>EXCESS NUTRIENTS</h3>
                        <img src="img/excess_nutrients.png">
                        <p>This graph shows that in our so-called “healthy” foods, we have a ton of extra sodium that we don’t need. However, it's important to keep in mind that both sodium and potassium are measured in milligrams and thus, changes to their content have a greater impact on these percentages. Because of this, we decided to take them out.</p>
                        <h3>EXCESS NUTRIENTS (EXCLUDING SODIUM AND POTASSIUM)</h3>
                        <img src="img/excess_nutrients_nona.png">
                        <p>What we can see here is that second to sodium and potassium, our best foods have the highest overages in proteins and saturated fats. So while these foods may be great for giving you all the essential nutrients you need, you may get a bit more then you bargained for in the form of sodium, protein, and saturated fats.</p>
	                    <p>Of course, this project wouldn’t be fun unless we looked at food that was bad for you as well. The same percent overage chart for the bad foods can be seen here.</p>

                        <p>So for bad foods, we can see that we get a lot of extra saturated fat, sodium, and total fat, not to mention the insane amount of calories that you would need to eat to get all of the calories you need.</p>

                        <h1>FINAL ANALYSIS</h1>
                        <p>Several foods could singularly fulfill the nutritional recommendations of a traditional diet. Spinach baby food provides the best balance of nutrients. Considering that the amount that must be eaten to reach 2000 calories is twice as much as that of the other foods, perhaps we should include grams as an additional parameter to draw a more reasonable conclusion (see appendix).<p>
                        <p>If you're skeptical about reliving the good ol' days with spinach mush, chicken noodle soup, chili and beans, or Kashi chicken fettuccini are great 'superfood' alternatives. It's worth noting that you need consume an average of 9 servings of each of these foods to get the proper amount of nutrients. Additionally, it is our assumption here is that you only consume one food. Even the makers of Soylent recommend a little dietary variety; anyone wishing to integrate these results into their own diets should keep that in mind.</p>
                        <p>Our 'best foods' tend to be lower in carbohydrates than the worse foods, and have a good balance of nutrients. Sodium levels in the foods tend to be extremely high, which makes sense, as most of them are pre-prepared meals.</p>
                        <p>On average, foods in the USDA database tend to have more excess fat and sodium than any other nutrient, which makes a lot of sense. Evolution has hard wired our bodies to crave those high-calorie nutrients; prehistoric supply of calories was low, and demand was high. While carbohydrates and protein contain 4 calories per gram, fat contains 9 calories per gram, making it especially efficient for providing the body with energy. Many companies who produce groceries and fast food are aware of the human craving for fat, and thusly pack their foods with it. These days, however, the actual need for fat/calories in general has heavily decreased, as most humans spend their days sitting instead of running around collecting food and avoiding predators. It is for this reason that the recommendations for fat consumption are so much lower than what food manufacturers and distributors are actually putting out.</p>

                        <p>When you look at the percent overages on the foods in the above graph, it's clear that they run into the same problems as most of the foods in our data set with high levels of sodium, protein, and fats. On the whole, the results we get when optimizing by weight exhibit similar characteristics to those found when we optimized by calorie, but reveal a different set of foods that serve a different purpose.</p>
